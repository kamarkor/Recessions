# Recessions
Estrella and Mishkin (1995) showed that the inversion of the yield curve could be significant in predicting economic recessions ðŸ“‰. This predictive ability has been theorized and extended to take into account other financial and non-financial explanatory variables. The purpose behind this project is to test this relationship on U.S. data using some machine learning techniques.
